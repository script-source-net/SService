# SService
<p>String Service Unit Production. We create an app with which you can manage your customers, your strings, your inventory,
the rackets of your customers and the people who strings the racket. You have the ability to make orders by the weight 
with which the rackets will be strung and these orders are matching the customers.</p>
<p>You will have the possibility to check all orders afterwards and at anytime you have the overview of your string 
inventory, because on the execution of the order you will note how many cm of the strings you used for stringing and
the app calculates so how many cm/in are left on the roll.</p>
<p>With this app you will have more control on your price calculation for the strings and more transparency to customers,
because the string inventory has the information about how expensiv the string roll was and how much a cm/in will cost.
Every racket which you string you can calculate how much it will cost the customer to let the racket string, even if
the customer wishes a hybrid 4 knot string the app calculates the price of goods correctly, based on the inventory.</p>
<p>When you are on a stringing job and you will finish the job, you have to input how many min./h you where occupied on 
this job and then the app will calculate your effort.</p>
<p>After all the app will make a bill for you and your customer with all prices and taxes included, so the customer
like you as the serivce partner have the overview about the whole process.</p>
